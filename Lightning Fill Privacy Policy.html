    <h1>Lightning Fill Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how "Lightning Fill" handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect or Track</h2>
    <p>We believe in user privacy above all. "Lightning Fill" does not collect, track, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. Your browsing history, personal information, and any data you fill in forms are not sent to our servers or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data saved by "Lightning Fill" for form autofill is stored exclusively on your local machine. This data is not encrypted by the extension, so we recommend you do not use "Lightning Fill" to store passwords or other highly sensitive information. You are in full control of your data, and you can manage or delete it at any time directly within the extension's settings.</p>

    <h2>Justification for Permissions</h2>
    <p>"Lightning Fill" requires certain permissions to function correctly. We request only the minimum necessary permissions to provide the core functionality of the extension.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> This permission is required to interact with the currently active browser tab when the user clicks the "Lightning Fill" extension icon. It allows the extension to read and change the content of the current webpage to autofill forms, but only after you have explicitly initiated the action. This ensures user privacy by granting temporary access to the active tab instead of persistent access to all websites.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting:</strong> This permission is necessary to inject a small script into the active page when you activate the extension. This script enables the "Lightning Fill" functionality, allowing it to programmatically fill out form fields on the page. This is a core function of the extension and is not possible without this permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Remote Code Use</h2>
    <p>Remote code is not used by this extension. All the code necessary for "Lightning Fill" to function is contained within the extension's bundled package. This ensures the security and stability of the extension and your data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at: prasad2995@gmail.com</p>
